Describe the task
Skills let you package expertise, like your complete brand identity, for Claude to automatically apply across conversations. Upload your color palette, define your typography standards, and specify when to use which elements. Claude can then apply your brand guidelines automatically in any chat, whether it's for a quarterly report, client presentation, or internal spreadsheet.
‍

Creating this skill takes minutes. To start, walk through your brand fonts, colors, and other stylistic choices. Ask Claude to structure the information into a reusable skill that activates whenever you need brand-consistent outputs.

I want to create a skill that applies our company's brand styling to any presentation, document, or spreadsheet I create in Claude. Here's what I need to encode:

Color Palette:
Dark: #141413 (primary text, dark backgrounds)

Light: #faf9f5 (light backgrounds, text on dark)

Mid Gray: #b0aea5 (secondary elements)

Light Gray: #e8e6dc (subtle backgrounds)

Orange: #d97757 (primary accent for important elements)

Blue: #6a9bcc (secondary accent)

Green: #788c5d (tertiary accent)

Typography:
Headings (24pt and larger): Poppins font, bold weight

Body text: Lora font, regular weight

Fallbacks: Arial for headings if Poppins unavailable, Georgia for body if Lora unavailable

Application Rules:
Apply Poppins to all slide titles and document headings
Apply Lora to body text and paragraphs
Use accent colors (orange, blue, green) for shapes, charts, and visual elements
Cycle through accent colors to maintain visual interest
Use dark color for primary text on light backgrounds
Use light color for text on dark backgrounds
Create a complete skill with proper structure that I can use whenever I need brand-consistent presentations. Include the SKILL.md file with clear instructions for when to use it and how it applies the styling.

Give Claude context
Upload any existing brand guidelines, style sheets, or design documentation to serve as examples that Claude can reference within the skill. Enable file creation and Skills in your settings so Claude can build the complete skill package with proper structure, code, and documentation.

Required context
Enable the Google Drive integration so Claude can access your brand reference file to further enhance your skill.

Optional context
Turn on Extended Thinking to help Claude make sophisticated decisions about when to apply which brand elements based on visual hierarchy and content importance.

What Claude creates
Claude produces a complete, working skill package with clear instructions for when the skill applies, brand color specifications with hex values, typography guidelines with fallback fonts, and implementation details. The skill activates automatically when you request your brand styling.

From Claude
I've created a comprehensive skill that will automatically apply your company's brand guidelines to every presentation, document, and spreadsheet you create in Claude.

View your brand-guidelines.skill

The skill includes:

SKILL.md - The core skill document with complete brand specifications
color-typography-specs.md - Detailed technical specifications with Python code examples
usage-examples.md - Practical examples showing how the skill works
brand_utils.py - Python utility module for easy implementation
Your Brand System
Color Palette:

Dark (#141413) - primary text
Light (#faf9f5) - backgrounds
Orange (#d97757) - primary accent
Blue (#6a9bcc) - secondary accent
Green (#788c5d) - tertiary accent
Plus mid gray and light gray for supporting elements
Typography:

Poppins Bold for all headings (fallback: Arial)
Lora Regular for all body text (fallback: Georgia)
How It Works
The skill activates automatically whenever you:

Create a new presentation, document, or spreadsheet
Edit existing .pptx, .docx, or .xlsx files
Request any business document creation
You don't need to mention brand guidelines - it just works! Just ask for what you need:

"Create a 10-slide presentation about Q4 results"
"Write a project proposal document"
"Make a budget tracking spreadsheet"
And the brand guidelines are automatically applied with:

Correct fonts and sizes
Brand color palette
Proper contrast ratios
Professional spacing
Accent colors in sequence

Test the skill
Create new content and watch your brand apply automatically without specifying colors or fonts. Claude handles all visual styling decisions based on your uploaded guidelines, letting you focus on content rather than formatting details.

Update the skill
Make changes or add additional visual standards to your skill as your brand evolves. Simply tell Claude your desired output, and it will edit your Skills as your needs evolve.

Update my brand guidelines skill. Use the dark background with light text for all title slides, but keep content slides light. Make the heading font size 28pt instead of 24pt. Also, add our new product colors to the brand guidelines skill: Purple #8B7AB8 for premium features, Teal #4A9B9B for analytics content. These should be used in charts when presenting those specific topics.

Stack your skills
Skills are composable, meaning they can reference each other for Claude to use them together. Your ‘brand-guidelines’ skill can work with other skills you've created—like product-research or writing-standards—to produce work that's both visually sophisticated and aligned with your other requirements

Create a pitch deck for our new product launch. Use my brand-guidelines skill for formatting and apply the product-research skill to find relevant information.

Tricks, tips, and troubleshooting
Understand how progressive disclosure works‍
When Claude evaluates a task, it first scans skill metadata (the description at the top) to see if the skill is relevant. Only if it matches does Claude load the full instructions. Reference files load only when actually needed. This means you can have many skills available without overwhelming Claude's context.

Add bundled scripts for deterministic execution
Instructions allow interpretation variance. Scripts execute identically every time. If your brand skill says "apply orange accent #d97757," Claude interprets how to apply it. If your skill includes scripts/apply_brand_colors.py with exact RGB values and application logic, execution is deterministic. Use scripts for specific color application, file transformations, data formatting, or anything where consistency matters more than flexibility. Keep instructions for decision-making, creative choices, and context-dependent behavior.

Learn more about skill creation
When you ask Claude to create a skill, Claude is using a skill-creator skill under the hood. This skill teaches Claude how to package your workflow into proper SKILL.md format, organize your files correctly, and package everything into a ZIP file. You describe your process in conversation and Claude uses the skill-creator skill to handle the translation of "I want bullets here and prose there" into the proper structure.
